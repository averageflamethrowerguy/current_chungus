length of the line to be returned is given by len. The line returned in the buffer is not null-terminated.
If there are sufficient unread bytes already waiting, the call will return right away, with those.
Otherwise, the calling process is blocked until a line of input is available to be returned. If the length of the
next available input line is longer than len bytes, only the first len bytes of the line are copied to the calling
process, and the remaining bytes of the line are saved by the kernel for the next TtyRead (by this or another
process). If the length of the next available input line is shorter than len bytes, only as many bytes are copied
to the calling process as are available in the input line; On success, the number of bytes actually copied into the
calling processâ€™s buffer is returned; in case of any error, the value ERROR is returned.

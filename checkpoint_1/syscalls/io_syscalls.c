Otherwise, the calling process is blocked until a line of input is available to be returned. If the length of the

process, and the remaining bytes of the line are saved by the kernel for the next TtyRead (by this or another

to the calling process as are available in the input line; On success, the number of bytes actually copied into the
calling processâ€™s buffer is returned; in case of any error, the value ERROR is returned.
